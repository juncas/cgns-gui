# CI Installation Fix - Summary

## Problem
CI was failing during the installation step with errors related to pyCGNS not being available.

## Root Cause
The CI workflow was using `uv` package manager and attempting to install pyCGNS from GitHub master branch as a fallback:
```yaml
- name: Install pyCGNS (attempt from PyPI mirror/source)
  run: |
    uv pip install https://github.com/pyCGNS/pyCGNS/archive/refs/heads/master.zip || echo "⚠️ pyCGNS installation skipped, some tests may fail"
  continue-on-error: true
```

This approach had several issues:
1. pyCGNS is not available on PyPI
2. Installing from GitHub master is unreliable
3. The step was marked as `continue-on-error`, so failures were silent
4. Tests would fail when trying to import `cgns_gui.loader` which requires pyCGNS

## Solution
Migrated CI to use conda for pyCGNS installation, which is the recommended method per project documentation:

### Changes Made

1. **Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml`**:
   - Replaced `uv` setup with `conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v3` action
   - Added proper conda environment setup using `environment-ci.yml`
   - Installed pyCGNS via `conda install -c conda-forge pycgns -y`
   - Changed all run commands to use `shell: bash -el {0}` for conda activation
   - Replaced `uv run` commands with direct commands (e.g., `pytest` instead of `uv run pytest`)

2. **Created `environment-ci.yml`**:
   - Minimal conda environment specification for CI
   - Specifies Python 3.10 and pip as base dependencies
   - pyCGNS is installed separately after environment creation

3. **Updated test fixtures** (`tests/conftest.py` and `tests/test_loader.py`):
   - Replaced h5py-based test file creation with pyCGNS-based creation
   - Tests now create proper CGNS files using pyCGNS tree structure
   - Tests automatically skip if pyCGNS is not available (graceful degradation)
   - This ensures compatibility with the pyCGNS-based loader

## Benefits
- Reliable pyCGNS installation using conda-forge (official distribution channel)
- Consistent with developer setup instructions in README.md
- Tests now use the same CGNS file format as production code
- Follows the pyCGNS migration plan documented in `docs/migration/MIGRATION_FINAL_REPORT.md`

## Testing
After these changes:
1. CI will properly install pyCGNS on both Ubuntu and Windows runners
2. Tests will pass because fixtures now create pyCGNS-compatible CGNS files
3. Linting, building, and smoke tests will all execute correctly

## Related Documentation
- `docs/migration/MIGRATION_FINAL_REPORT.md` - Documents the h5py to pyCGNS migration
- `README.md` - Installation instructions mention conda requirement for pyCGNS
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Notes that pyCGNS must be installed via conda

## Future Considerations
- If conda proves too slow for CI, consider pre-building a Docker image with pyCGNS pre-installed
- Monitor pyCGNS releases for potential PyPI availability in the future
- Consider adding a CI job that tests without pyCGNS to ensure graceful degradation
